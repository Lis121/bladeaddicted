Every time a new element, page, or Edge Function is created, you must establish a detailed entry in the project's "Architectural Notes" describing what the component is and what it does. These notes are living documents that must be updated immediately as code changes or new functionality is added, ensuring the documentation always provides an accurate and current view of the application's architecture.
